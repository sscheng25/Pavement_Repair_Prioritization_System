# Reimagining Road Repairs

### Hi there! This repository is for a MUSA Practicum project at the University of Pennsylvania. [Learn more about the Practicum course and view all projects here.](https://pennmusa.github.io/MUSA_801.io/)

#### This project was completed by Kristin Chang, Sisun Cheng, and Jenna Epstein with the help of Alex Hoffman, AICP at the El Paso Capital Improvements Department and MUSA Faculty: Michael Fichman, Matt Harris, and Mjumbe Poe.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a web application for the El Paso Capital Improvement Department's Planning Division. The department interested in improving their system for deciding where and how to allocate capital improvement funds for road repairs. Presently, this is determined using a Pavement Condition Index (PCI). In 2018, a private contractor assigned each road segment under the city's jurisidiction a PCI score based on a digital image scan. With this knowledge, we can infer that PCI scores are heavily dependent on physical conditions of the road such as potholes, cracks, or bumps. <br>

Whenever the city receives a request for a repair, they confirm that the PCI score for that road segment is low, and fulfill the request. This current decision-making process is reactive and can be made more proactive by using machine learning to predict future PCI scores. Additionally, incorporating contextual layers such as the population that the roads are servicing, the level of traffic congestion, or how a road repair may contribute to a Vision Zero or Safe Streets city plan expands the decision-making process beyond just PCI. The web application accomplishes these goals by allowing users to view road segments by PCI score overlayed on data layers of Equity, Road Safety, Traffic Congestion, and Flood Risk. These layers were chosen in collaboration with our client per a community survey sent out by the city.
